   Lightning" McQueen is an anthropomorphic stock car in the animated Pixar film Cars (2006), its sequels Cars 2 (2011), Cars 3 (2017), and TV shorts known as Cars Toons. The character is not named after actor and race driver Steve McQueen, but after Pixar animator Glenn McQueen who died in 2002. His design is inspired by NASCAR stock cars. His body comes from various Gen 4 NASCARs, however, he has a curvaceous design like that of the Plymouth Superbird and Dodge Charger Daytona NASCARs, the exhaust pipes come from the 1970s Dodge Charger NASCARs, but with four (two on each side) instead of two on one side or one on both sides. He also has some curvaceous cues from the Ford GT40 and Lola T70, along with cab cues from a 1990s Porsche 911, although he is primarily and mainly based on NASCAR stock cars. "[1] During the scene where he helps restore Radiator Springs to its 1950s heyday, he is painted much like a 1950s Chevrolet Corvette C1, once again hinting at his Corvette lineage. His number was originally set to be 57, Lasseter's birth year, but was changed to 95, the release year of Pixar's first film Toy Story. In Cars, his engine sounds come from a Gen 4 NASCAR. In Cars 2, some of his engine sounds come from a Chevrolet Impala SS COT NASCAR, and some come from the Chevrolet Corvette C6.R. And in Cars 3, his engine sounds come from a Gen 5 NASCAR.

  The 502hp, 6.2-litre V8 in the new C8 is mounted behind the driver and gives the Stingray a claimed 0-96kph time of under 3.0sec, making it the fastest base-level Corvette yet. Switching to a mid-engine layout has increased the length of the new model by 137mm, to 4,630mm, with the wheelbase stretched to 2,723mm.
